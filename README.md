# dailyplanner

The purpose of this project is to create a calendar/planner which can save events for hours of day and highlight whether the timeblock is in the past, present, or future. CSS and base HTML files have been provided, all's left to do is adding timeblocks in the HTML as well as jquery(script) file. This project utilizes moment.js library to get date and time for title section, jquery to create interactive app (saving, adding class to object, etc.), and local storage to keep events saved even after re-loading/refreshing the page.

Achievements:
1. When the calendar/planner is opened, the top section displays current day
2. When calendar is opened, timeblocks for business hours are opened with color codes indicating past, present, or future. Past= grey, present= red , future= green
3. Users are able to write/type events on timeblocks when they click it
4. When save button is clicked, events will be saved in local storage and remained on timeblocks even when refreshed
